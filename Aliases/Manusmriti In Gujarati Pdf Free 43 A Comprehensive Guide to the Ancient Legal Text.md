## What is Manusmriti?
 
Manusmriti is a Sanskrit word that means "the code of Manu" or "the laws of Manu". Manu is believed to be the first human being and the progenitor of mankind according to Hindu mythology. He is also regarded as the author of Manusmriti, although some scholars suggest that the text was composed by multiple authors over a long period of time. Manusmriti is also known by other names, such as Manava Dharmashastra (the science of human law), Manava Dharma Vidhi (the rule of human law), or simply Dharmashastra (the science of law).
 
Manusmriti is one of the oldest and most influential legal texts in Hinduism. It belongs to a genre of literature called Smriti, which means "that which is remembered". Smriti texts are based on Shruti, which means "that which is heard". Shruti texts are considered to be the direct revelation of God or the eternal truth, such as the Vedas and the Upanishads. Smriti texts are considered to be human interpretations or elaborations of Shruti texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas.
 
Manusmriti is divided into 12 chapters or skandas, each containing several verses or shlokas. The total number of verses varies according to different manuscripts and editions, but it is generally around 2,700. The chapters cover various topics related to law and society, such as creation, sources of law, duties of different varnas and ashramas, rules of conduct for men and women, marriage and family life, inheritance and property rights, civil and criminal law, penance and purification, royal duties and administration, taxation and revenue collection, diplomacy and war, etc.
